### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
# dsbox installed.

library(tidyverse) 
library(devtools)
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("rstudio-education/dsbox")
library(dsbox)
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

```{r Ex.1}
print(ncol(dennys))
print(nrow(dennys))

```
# answer for Ex 1:we have 6 columns and 1643 rows. Each row represents one Denny’s location. the variables include latitude, longitude, city, state, and address.

### Exercise 2

```{r Ex.2}
# What are the dimensions of the La Quinta’s dataset? 
print(ncol(laquinta))
print(nrow(laquinta))
```
# answer for Ex 2:we have 6 columns and 909 rows. Each row represents one La Quinta’s location. the variables include latitude, longitude, city, state, and address.

### Exercise 3
```{r Ex.3}
# Take a look at the websites that the data come from.
# answer for Ex.3: Are there any La Quinta’s locations outside of the US? based on the link, I think, no, there's no La Quinta outside the us. 
# What about Denny’s? based on the link, I think there's no Denny's outside the US? but I Google it instead, and it shows there are some Denny's outside of the US, like Canada and Mexico. 
```
...

### Exercise 4
```{r Ex.4}
# Now take a look at the data. What would be some ways of determining whether or not either establishment has any locations outside the US using just the data (and not the websites).

# we can use "filter" function, and I think it's a most straightforward way to use. 

```
...

### Exercise 5
```{r Ex.5}
# filter the Denny’s locations for observations where state is not in states$abbreviation.

dennys %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))

# there's no Denny's location outside the US, based on my data. 

```

...

### Exercise 6
```{r Ex.6}
# Add a country variable to the Denny’s dataset and set all observations equal to "United States". 
dennys_us <- dennys %>%
  mutate(country = "United States")
print(ncol(dennys_us))
print(nrow(dennys_us))

```

...

### Exercise 7
```{r Ex.7}
# Find the La Quinta locations that are outside the US, and figure out which country they are in.

laquinta_outside_us <- laquinta %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
# I filter out the locations that are outside the US.
print(ncol(laquinta_outside_us))
print(nrow(laquinta_outside_us))

print(laquinta_outside_us)
# now, just search for these address, I can tell which country they are in. 

```


### Exercise 8
```{r Ex.8}
# Add a country variable to the La Quinta dataset. Use the case_when function to populate this variable.

laquinta_country <- laquinta %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
   state %in% states$abbreviation ~ "United States",  
    state == "ON" ~ "Canada",  
    state == "BC" ~ "Canada",  
    state == "QC" ~ "Canada",  
    state == "NL" ~ "Canada",   
    state == "MX" ~ "Mexico",  
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"  
  ))
  
print(laquinta_country)

# work with the data from the United States only
laquinta_us <- laquinta_country %>% 
 filter(country == "United States")

```
### Exercise 9
```{r Ex.9}
# Which states have the most and fewest Denny’s locations? What about La Quinta?

dennys %>%
  count(state) %>%
  inner_join(states, by = c("state" = "abbreviation"))


```
### Exercise 10
```{r-Ex.10}
# Which states have the most Denny’s locations per thousand square miles? What about La Quinta?

dennys <- dennys %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")
laquinta <- laquinta %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")

dennys_laquinta <- bind_rows(dennys, laquinta)

ggplot(dennys_laquinta, mapping = aes(
  x = longitude,
  y = latitude,
  color = establishment
)) +
  geom_point()


```
### Exercise 11
```{r-Ex.11}
# Filter the data for observations in North Carolina only, and recreate the plot. 

dennys_laquinta %>% 
   filter(state == "NC") %>%
   ggplot(mapping = aes(
   x = longitude,
   y = latitude,
   color = establishment
 )) +
   geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6) + 
   labs(title = "Location of Dennys vs. Laquinta in NC")

# the joke may not hold true here, I think? based on this plot, I can only see 4 locations that the two are super close to each other.

```
### Exercise 12
```{r-EX.12}
# Now filter the data for observations in Texas only, and recreate the plot.

dennys_laquinta %>% 
   filter(state == "TX") %>%
   ggplot(mapping = aes(
   x = longitude,
   y = latitude,
   color = establishment
 )) +
   geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.25) + 
   labs(title = "Location of Dennys vs. Laquinta in TX")

# the joke hold true in TX, they do cluster more tightly here. 

```
